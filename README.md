# Briefmetrics

Briefmetrics emails you simple overviews of your website's Google Analytics.


## Status

The project has been stable for over 5 years. It is in maintenance mode.

The source code is offered without any support guarantees.

Conservative contributions are welcome: Bug fixes, documentation, mild feature
improvements. For anything that could increase the maintenance burden, please
start a fork.


## Usage

See the `./docker` directory for deployment, or the `Makefile` for setting up
the development environment.

Sorry about the lack of more complete usage instructions, documentation
contributon is welcome!


## Security

This is an old codebase with commit history dating back to 2013. It's
fascinating to dig through old code and see how it evolved, so I did not want
to purge the commit history while sharing the codebase publically.

Some old secrets have already been rotated and discarded:
- `FB9ocrxz9witysKA8tcMnMh5`

If you find anything sensitive in the code or commit history, please report it
privately. I am [@shazow on Keybase](http://keybase.io/shazow), or email me at
`andrey@briefmetrics.com`.
