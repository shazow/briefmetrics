# Briefmetrics

Briefmetrics emails you simple overviews of your website's Google Analytics.


## Status

The live instance is shut down as of July 2023.

The project has been stable for over 5+ years. It is in maintenance mode.

The source code is offered without any support guarantees.

Generally not looking for contributions at this point, but forks are welcome! Will happily link back any substantial fork efforts.


## Usage

See the `./docker` directory for deployment, or the `Makefile` for setting up
the development environment.

Sorry about the lack of more complete usage instructions, documentation
contributon is welcome!


## Security

This is an old codebase with commit history dating back to 2013. It's
fascinating to dig through old code and see how it evolved, so I did not want
to purge the commit history while sharing the codebase publically.

Some old secrets have already been rotated and discarded:
- `FB9ocrxz9witysKA8tcMnMh5`

If you find anything sensitive in the code or commit history, please report it
privately. I am [@shazow on Keybase](http://keybase.io/shazow), or email me at
`andrey@briefmetrics.com`.
