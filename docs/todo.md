Hi there. I'm building a service which sends email summaries of your Google Analytics and I was wondering if this could be useful to Hop Online?

I have a few web agencies using Briefmetrics to keep their clients engaged with their analytics through weekly reports. I'd love to get Hop Online to try it out: https://briefmetrics.com/

I hope Briefmetrics can be helpful to your business.
